Welcome! This repo is dedicated to the design of the Rede language. New Rede language features are considered, defined, and specified here.

Specifically, in this repo, you can find:

- The full language specifications for all released versions.
- The potential language specifications for all versions currently under consideration.
- A summary of the language version history.

The language is implemented in the rede-org/language-dev repo, based upon the design specifications outlined here.

## Contributing

A process for evaluating language feature proposals will be set up after version 1 has been released. For now, if you would like to contribute please [email us](mailto:lucas@lucasstertz.com).
