# Scope

This specification describes:
- The generalized architecture of Rede code.
- The expected grammatical structure of Rede code.
- How the grammatical structure translates to rules and restrictions for interpreters of Rede code.
- The expected architectural and functional meaning of interpreted Rede code.

This specification does not describe:
- The systems and functionality offered by an implementation of the Rede programming language (e.g., built-in runtime contexts).
- How Rede code is interpreted to compose a functioning program.
- How a Rede program is transformed or ran by any system.
- The specific details of a program created from interpreted Rede code (e.g., size or complexity).
- The specific requirements to run a program created from interpreted Rede code.
- The structure, processes, or input/output transformations of any external system in relation to a Rede program.
